## Rules

1. Ensure you have a GitHub account, and Fork this repo.
2. Clone your Fork down locally.
3. Cut code alone, or as a team to build something that has to be open source and hosted on GitHub - that matches the announced theme.
4. Make sure you push your code commits back up to GitHub before the day ends.
5. We'll vote on winners (or get one of the wonderful staff from Love Coffee to choose a winner).
6. Have fun!

We have prizes!
